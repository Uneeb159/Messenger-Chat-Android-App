# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes the input field label positioning issue in the login and signup screens where the hint text (Email, Password) moves upward when focused but appears partially outside the input field boundaries, creating a poor user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user interacting with login form fields, I want the label text to stay properly positioned within the input field boundaries when focused, so that the interface looks polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user focuses on the email input field THEN the system SHALL keep the label text properly positioned within the input field visual boundaries
2. WHEN user focuses on the password input field THEN the system SHALL keep the label text properly positioned within the input field visual boundaries
3. WHEN the label animates upward on focus THEN the system SHALL ensure the label remains fully visible and contained within the input field styling
4. WHEN the input field is unfocused and empty THEN the system SHALL return the label to its original hint position
5. WHEN the input field has content THEN the system SHALL keep the label in the focused position even when unfocused

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user interacting with signup form fields, I want the label text to stay properly positioned within the input field boundaries when focused, so that the interface looks polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user focuses on the email input field THEN the system SHALL keep the label text properly positioned within the input field visual boundaries
2. WHEN user focuses on the password input field THEN the system SHALL keep the label text properly positioned within the input field visual boundaries
3. WHEN user focuses on the confirm password input field THEN the system SHALL keep the label text properly positioned within the input field visual boundaries
4. WHEN the label animates upward on focus THEN the system SHALL ensure the label remains fully visible and contained within the input field styling
5. WHEN any input field is unfocused and empty THEN the system SHALL return the label to its original hint position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user using the forgot password dialog, I want the email input field label to behave consistently with the main form fields, so that the experience feels cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user focuses on the email input field in forgot password dialog THEN the system SHALL keep the label text properly positioned within the input field visual boundaries
2. WHEN the label animates in the dialog THEN the system SHALL use the same positioning behavior as the main login form
