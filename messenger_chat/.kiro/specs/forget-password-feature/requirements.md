# Forget Password Feature Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a forget password feature in the FuseChat application. The feature will allow users who have forgotten their passwords to reset them securely through email verification, providing a seamless recovery experience while maintaining security best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who has forgotten my password, I want to be able to reset it using my email address, so that I can regain access to my account without losing my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps the "Forgot Password?" link on the login screen THEN the system SHALL display a password reset screen
2. WHEN a user enters their email address on the password reset screen THEN the system SHALL validate the email format
3. WHEN a user submits a valid email address THEN the system SHALL send a password reset email to that address
4. WHEN the password reset email is sent successfully THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message with instructions
5. WHEN a user clicks the reset link in their email THEN the system SHALL open the app or browser with a secure reset interface
6. WHEN a user enters and confirms their new password THEN the system SHALL validate password strength requirements
7. WHEN the new password meets all requirements THEN the system SHALL update the user's password and confirm the change

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during the password reset process, so that I understand what steps to take and the current status of my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates password reset THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator during processing
2. WHEN the reset email is sent THEN the system SHALL display a success message with clear next steps
3. WHEN there is an error (invalid email, network issue, etc.) THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user successfully resets their password THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation and redirect to login
5. WHEN a user tries to use an expired or invalid reset link THEN the system SHALL display an error and offer to resend

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the password reset process to be secure and follow best practices, so that my account remains protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a password reset is requested THEN the system SHALL generate a secure, time-limited reset token
2. WHEN a reset link is used THEN the system SHALL validate the token is not expired (15-minute expiry)
3. WHEN a reset link is used THEN the system SHALL invalidate the token after successful password change
4. WHEN multiple reset requests are made THEN the system SHALL only honor the most recent valid token
5. WHEN a new password is set THEN the system SHALL enforce password strength requirements (minimum 6 characters)
6. WHEN password reset is completed THEN the system SHALL log out all existing sessions for security

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the forget password feature to have a beautiful, consistent design that matches the app's theme, so that the experience feels seamless and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the forget password screen is displayed THEN it SHALL use the same gradient background as other auth screens
2. WHEN form elements are shown THEN they SHALL match the purple theme and styling of login/signup screens
3. WHEN animations are displayed THEN they SHALL be consistent with the app's animation style
4. WHEN success/error messages are shown THEN they SHALL use the app's snackbar styling and colors
5. WHEN the user navigates between screens THEN transitions SHALL be smooth and consistent
