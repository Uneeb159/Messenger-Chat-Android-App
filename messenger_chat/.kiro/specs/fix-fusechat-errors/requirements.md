# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical errors preventing the FuseChat Flutter application from running. The project has missing service files, incorrect test references, and code quality issues that need to be resolved to make the application functional.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the missing GetServerKey service to be implemented, so that push notifications can be sent properly in the chat application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application attempts to send push notifications THEN the system SHALL have access to a GetServerKey service
2. WHEN GetServerKey().getServerKeyToken() is called THEN the system SHALL return a valid Firebase access token
3. WHEN the service is imported in chart_screen.dart THEN the system SHALL compile without URI errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the widget tests to reference the correct main app class, so that automated testing can run successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running widget tests THEN the system SHALL reference the correct FuseChat class instead of MyApp
2. WHEN the test runs THEN the system SHALL properly instantiate the main application widget
3. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL not throw class reference errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want code quality issues to be resolved, so that the application follows Flutter best practices and maintains clean code standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN widgets are created THEN the system SHALL include proper key parameters for public widgets
2. WHEN constructors are defined for immutable classes THEN the system SHALL use const constructors where appropriate
3. WHEN production code is written THEN the system SHALL use proper logging instead of print statements
4. WHEN null-aware operators are used THEN the system SHALL only use them when the left operand can actually be null
