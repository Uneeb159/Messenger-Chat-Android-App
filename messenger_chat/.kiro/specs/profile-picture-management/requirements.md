# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to upload, display, and manage their profile pictures in the FuseChat messenger application. The profile picture will be visible in the slide drawer and to other users when viewing profiles. Since Firebase Storage is a paid service, we'll implement an alternative solution using base64 encoding and Firestore for storage, with local caching for performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload a profile picture so that other users can identify me visually in the chat application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps on the profile round icon in the slide drawer THEN the system SHALL display an option to upload a picture
2. WHEN a user selects "upload picture" THEN the system SHALL open device gallery/camera picker
3. WHEN a user selects an image THEN the system SHALL compress and resize the image to optimize storage
4. WHEN image processing is complete THEN the system SHALL upload the image data to Firestore as base64
5. WHEN upload is successful THEN the system SHALL display a success message and update the UI immediately
6. WHEN upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my profile picture in the slide drawer so that I can confirm my identity and see my current picture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the slide drawer THEN the system SHALL display the user's profile picture if one exists
2. WHEN no profile picture exists THEN the system SHALL display a default avatar placeholder
3. WHEN the profile picture is loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
4. WHEN the profile picture fails to load THEN the system SHALL display the default avatar

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my existing profile picture so that I can update or remove it as needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with an existing profile picture taps on their profile picture THEN the system SHALL display two options: "Upload Picture" and "Delete Picture"
2. WHEN a user selects "Upload Picture" THEN the system SHALL follow the same upload flow as Requirement 1
3. WHEN a user selects "Delete Picture" THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog
4. WHEN user confirms deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the picture from Firestore and update the UI to show default avatar
5. WHEN user cancels deletion THEN the system SHALL close the dialog without changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see other users' profile pictures when viewing their profiles so that I can visually identify them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing another user's profile THEN the system SHALL display their profile picture if one exists
2. WHEN the other user has no profile picture THEN the system SHALL display a default avatar
3. WHEN loading another user's profile picture THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
4. WHEN another user's profile picture fails to load THEN the system SHALL display the default avatar

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to perform well when loading profile pictures so that the user experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a profile picture is loaded for the first time THEN the system SHALL cache it locally for future use
2. WHEN a cached profile picture exists THEN the system SHALL load it from cache before checking for updates
3. WHEN uploading an image THEN the system SHALL compress images larger than 500KB to reduce storage usage
4. WHEN multiple profile pictures are displayed THEN the system SHALL load them asynchronously without blocking the UI
5. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL preload the current user's profile picture for immediate display

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use a cost-effective storage solution so that the app can scale without high storage costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing profile pictures THEN the system SHALL use Firestore with base64 encoding instead of Firebase Storage
2. WHEN compressing images THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable quality while minimizing file size
3. WHEN caching images THEN the system SHALL implement cache expiration to prevent unlimited storage growth
4. WHEN handling image data THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes before processing
