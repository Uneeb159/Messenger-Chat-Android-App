2. WHEN the splash screen is shown THEN it SHALL display "Messenger Chat" branding
3. WHEN any screen title or header references the app THEN it SHALL use "Messenger Chat" instead of "FuseChat"
4. WHEN error messages or notifications mention the app THEN they SHALL reference "Messenger Chat"
5. WHEN the about screen is displayed THEN it SHALL show "Messenger Chat" as the application name
6. WHEN any user-facing text mentions the app THEN it SHALL consistently use "Messenger Chat"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the app's technical configuration to reflect the new branding, so that the app is properly identified in app stores and system settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN app metadata is generated THEN it SHALL include "Messenger Chat" as the application name
5. WHEN the app description is shown THEN it SHALL reference "Messenger Chat" functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want all import statements and internal references to be updated, so that the codebase is clean and maintainable with the new branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Dart files import screens or components THEN they SHALL use updated import paths reflecting the new branding
2. WHEN package references are made THEN they SHALL use the updated package name structure
3. WHEN route names are defined THEN they SHALL reflect "Messenger Chat" branding where appropriate
4. WHEN class names or identifiers reference the old branding THEN they SHALL be updated to reflect "Messenger Chat"
5. WHEN configuration files are processed THEN they SHALL contain the updated branding information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the rebranding to maintain all existing functionality, so that the app continues to work exactly as before with just the updated branding.

#### Acceptance Criteria
