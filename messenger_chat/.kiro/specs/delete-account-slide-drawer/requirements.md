# Delete Account in Slide Drawer Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for replacing the logout option in the slide drawer with a delete account feature. The feature will allow users to permanently delete their account and all associated data directly from the slide drawer, providing a secure and user-friendly account deletion process while maintaining data integrity and security best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the delete account option from the slide drawer instead of logout, so that I can easily find and use the account deletion feature when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the slide drawer THEN the system SHALL display "Delete Account" option instead of "Logout"
2. WHEN a user taps the "Delete Account" option THEN the system SHALL close the drawer and navigate to the delete account screen
3. WHEN the slide drawer is displayed THEN it SHALL show Profile Photo, Profile, About, and Delete Account options in that order
4. WHEN the delete account option is displayed THEN it SHALL use appropriate warning styling (red color) to indicate destructive action
5. WHEN the delete account option is tapped THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation to the dedicated delete account screen

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the delete account process to be secure and require proper authentication, so that my account cannot be deleted accidentally or by unauthorized users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates account deletion THEN the system SHALL require password re-authentication for security
2. WHEN password verification fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent deletion
3. WHEN password verification succeeds THEN the system SHALL proceed with the deletion confirmation process
4. WHEN multiple failed password attempts occur THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate security measures
5. WHEN the deletion process is initiated THEN the system SHALL clearly warn about the permanent nature of the action

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all my data to be completely removed when I delete my account, so that no personal information remains in the system after deletion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN account deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL delete the user's Firestore document from the users collection
2. WHEN account deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL delete all chat messages sent by the user
3. WHEN account deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL delete the user's profile picture data if it exists
4. WHEN account deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL delete the user's FCM token and notification preferences
5. WHEN account deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL delete the Firebase Authentication account
6. WHEN all data is deleted THEN the system SHALL navigate the user back to the welcome screen
7. WHEN data deletion fails partially THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback and confirmation during the account deletion process, so that I understand the consequences and current status of the deletion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the delete account screen is displayed THEN it SHALL clearly explain that deletion is permanent and irreversible
2. WHEN the user enters their password THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback for password validation
3. WHEN the deletion process starts THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator with appropriate messaging
4. WHEN deletion is successful THEN the system SHALL display a confirmation message before navigating away
5. WHEN deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and recovery options
6. WHEN the user navigates through the deletion process THEN all UI elements SHALL maintain consistency with the app's purple theme

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the delete account feature to have proper error handling and recovery options, so that I can resolve any issues that occur during the deletion process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
2. WHEN Firebase authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and guidance
3. WHEN partial data deletion occurs THEN the system SHALL attempt to complete the process or provide recovery steps
4. WHEN the user cancels the deletion process THEN the system SHALL safely return to the previous screen without data loss
5. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriate information for debugging while protecting user privacy
